# ThurstyUtilities

If you've found this, you're likely one of my coworkers. Hi! I wrote this because we do a lot of stuff that's very repetetive, and a lot of stuff that's overly complicated for how simple the result is, and I wanted to make it easier on us.

## Prerequisites

Right now, there's only 3 things this module requires: An updated version of PowerShell, and two Microsoft modules that run as dependencies.

To update to the newest version of PowerShell, run the following command in an Admin-Elevated PowerShell window:

`winget install Microsoft.PowerShell --scope machine`

Then, to install the required modules, you'll need to run the following:

`Install-Module Microsoft.Graph`

`Install-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement`

You can get the currently imported modules with `Get-Module`, and if you don't see Microsoft Graph or Exchange Online, you can just run these commands:

`Import-Module Microsoft.Graph`

`Import-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement`

That should leave you all set with the most up to date version of PowerShell and the necessary modules to run this one!

## Installing

I try to keep an up-to-date copy of the module on our servers, so installing the module should be as easy as importing directly from the server.

`Import-Module \\cozen\phq\shared\sthurston\ThurstyUtilities`

For the more advanced, you can always clone the repository locally and import from there. Or clone directly into your PowerShell Modules directory and implicity import.
